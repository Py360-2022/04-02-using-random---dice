# Instructions  

You will use the  random library to simulate 2 dice rolls! Then display the value "rolled" 

## first
  1. add the import statement for the random library
  1. generate a random number, twice ; a 6 sided dice shows 1 - 6
  1. display the "roll"

Run your program a few times. The 2 dice should be different each time 

## second
Now, set the seed (before you generate a random number) and notice that the random number sequence is the same each time you run
ex `random.seed(10)`

## Test data
* none, it's random
